# ESP32-WiFi-Packets
This program can be used to see TCP, UDP, ICMP, and other incoming packets to an ESP32 board that is connected to a WiFi network. A different color LED is also turned on when different protocol packets are received (red for ICMP, green for TCP, Blue for UDP, and yellow for others). Other communication protocols can easily be added in the switch.
